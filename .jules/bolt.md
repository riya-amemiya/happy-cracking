## 2026-02-11 - BigUint Overhead
**Learning:** Using `BigUint` for modular arithmetic on numbers that fit in native types (`u64`, `u128`) introduces massive overhead (~28x slower for primality test).
**Action:** Always prefer native integer arithmetic (`u128` for intermediate calculations) when inputs are small enough, especially in hot loops like primality testing.
