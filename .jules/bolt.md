## 2026-02-11 - BigUint Overhead
**Learning:** Using `BigUint` for modular arithmetic on numbers that fit in native types (`u64`, `u128`) introduces massive overhead (~28x slower for primality test).
**Action:** Always prefer native integer arithmetic (`u128` for intermediate calculations) when inputs are small enough, especially in hot loops like primality testing.

## 2026-02-11 - modpow optimization
**Learning:** Generic `modpow` implementations using `BigUint` are costly even for small numbers.
**Action:** Always check if modulus fits in `u64` and dispatch to a `u128`-based fast path. This yielded ~4.8x speedup for `modpow`.

## 2026-02-12 - Factorization Algorithms
**Learning:** Trial division is exponentially slow for large inputs ($O(\sqrt{n})$), making it unusable for 64-bit semi-primes.
**Action:** Use Pollard's Rho ($O(n^{1/4})$) for composite numbers. This reduced factorization time for a 64-bit semi-prime from 22s to 0.035s (~600x speedup).
